        Absolutely! Simply book an “APPOINTMENT” to speak to me directly about our services via Zoom video chat and discuss your needs and program details.
        Keep in mind, if you do book this call and do not attend your scheduled time within 10 minutes of the start time, I will leave the call and continue with my workday.

        Simple. I believe that everyone is in a different place physically and psychologically and the body you see in a picture used for marketing is not yours. Comparing yourself to others should not be a prime motivation. I feel a person should compare themselves to themselves as that is the real measure! You have a unique genetic makeup, fitness level, and sensitivity to exercise and your results are your own. <br><br>
        I choose not to exploit our clients and perpetuate the fitness scams plaguing the internet and media. I also dislike manipulative and disingenuous marketing and the fitness industry is notorious for it and I want nothing to do with that. Be the best version of yourself, not someone else.

        Your professional fitness and nutrition coach will determine the general course of coaching calls based on their observations, your conversations, and any other data they collect relevant to you. This included information in your original assessment form, conversations, or messages. The typical coaching session follows a three-system format which includes laundry/fitness review, nutrition/food review, and general mindset coaching. <br><br>
        Often, your coach will ask you to submit a video of you performing a certain exercise or may have you demonstrate live on a call to ensure quality movements and risk assessment.<br><br>
        Conveniently send short exercise videos for your coach to review right through the Forge app messenger.

        Because every single client program is built from scratch, it can take a few days to have everything done and loaded. Our goal is to have all new client programs built, loaded, and reviewed within 1-3 days from enrollment. Sometimes, a new client has highly specific needs or conditions and that may take up to 2-4 days to nail down, especially with complex nutrition issues.<br><br>
        Sometimes, if a client enrolls on a weekend there may be an additional delay as most coaches are not active on Sunday. We prefer to get all clients motivated and fully engaged in their program as soon as possible!

        Yes! One thing that separates Forge from other online training options is we have a fully licensed and Registered Dietitian in-house. <br><br>
        Your coach will provide nutritional education no matter your program type but the Complete and Premium programs include a personalized meal plan based on your food preferences and dietary needs. <br><br>          
        Because of the low cost and coaching contact, the Standard program does not include a custom meal plan but ALL clients have access to a large database of meal plans and recipes. <br><br>          
        However, if you are a client on the Standard program you may request an add-on service by messaging your coach in the Forge app.

        Yes! We do offer the option to purchase additional coaching sessions if you and your coach feel these added sessions may improve your success toward your goals. Additional coaching sessions may be purchased for $50 per half hour. These sessions can be purchased as a single session or in packages. <br><br>
        Additional sessions are mostly used for exercise technique correction in a live setting for real-time feedback. You may also use these coaching sessions to schedule a supplemental call with our Registered Dietitian. <br><br>          
        Keep in mind, these sessions may be subject to availability depending on your coach’s client load. Speak with your coach for details if you feel the extra support and professional guidance would benefit you.

        You may request a particular coach and we will do our best to accommodate. However, I cannot guarantee the coach you prefer will be available or currently accepting new clients. <br><br>
        We do provide a “status” of each coach’s current availability on our About Page in each coach biography. If you do not have a preference, I will select a coach based on availability.

        No problem! One of the outstanding benefits of working with Forge is our adaptability to your resources and lifestyle. I work with individuals that travel, have tight schedules or simply do not want to or can’t get to a commercial fitness center. While gym memberships are very helpful in adding verity to your program by way of providing a wide range of equipment options, it is not necessary to see a degree of fitness success. Each program is based on what you have available.  For clients with home gyms, I will build the program with all of your equipment in mind. I do encourage clients to make modest investments in resistance bands, stability balls or other apparatus that will add benefits to and accelerate reaching your potential.

        Depending on the type of injury and the stage of healing, Your coach can create programs that limit or avoid stress to the affected site. We can also develop corrective exercise strategies to improve mobility, joint stabilization, connective tissue strength, and flexibility. <br><br>
        To learn more about the qualifications and expertise of our coaches, see our About page <br><br>          
        However, no corrective exercise or post-rehabilitation program delivered by any Forge coach is intended to diagnose, treat or cure any disease or mechanical malalignment. Within our scope of practice, we will work with you to fine-tune a progressive program that works to inhibit overactive musculature, stimulate underactive muscle structures, activate biomechanical efficiency, and integrate compound movements to enhance functionality.

        I strongly encourage client and trainer communication! Phone/Video calls should be a scheduled appointment based on the Forge service plan you choose. I strive to deliver the highest level of service and this is why I personally accept only a limited number of clients (overflow goes to other Forge coaches) and why phone or video chats must be scheduled in advance. One of the primary advantages to working with Forge is the ability to instant message your trainer right from the mobile app 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. All Forge coaches reply super quick as well! <br><br>
        Please see our Contact page to book an appointment.
